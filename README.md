  - Hard to scale: May not be suitable for very large projects.

2. Waterfall: Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase (e.g., requirements, design, development) must be completed before the next begins.
- Advantages:
  - Clear structure: Well-defined stages and milestones make it easier to manage and plan.
  - Documentation-heavy: Comprehensive documentation helps in future maintenance.
  - Predictability: Easier to estimate timelines and budgets since changes are less frequent.

- Disadvantages:
  - Inflexibility: Difficult to adapt to changes once the project is underway.
  - Late testing: Testing happens only after development, which increases the risk of encountering major issues late in the process.
  - Delayed client feedback: The client may not see the product until the project is near completion.

Main Differences:
- Flexibility: Agile is adaptable, while Waterfall follows a fixed plan.
- Client Involvement: Agile requires continuous involvement, while Waterfall involves the client mostly at the start and end.
- Delivery: Agile delivers incrementally, whereas Waterfall delivers the complete product at the end.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile vs. Waterfall: Choosing the Right Methodology
The choice between Agile and Waterfall methodologies often depends on the specific characteristics of a project. Here are some scenarios where one approach might be more beneficial than the other:

When to Choose Agile:
Projects with Uncertain Requirements: When requirements are likely to change or evolve over time, Agile's flexibility allows for adjustments.
Complex Projects: Agile's iterative approach can help break down large, complex projects into smaller, more manageable chunks.
Projects Requiring Frequent Feedback: Agile's focus on delivering working software early and often enables continuous feedback from stakeholders.
Projects with Innovative Solutions: Agile's emphasis on experimentation and learning can be advantageous for projects exploring new and uncharted territories.
Example: Developing a new mobile app with evolving features and market trends would be well-suited for an Agile approach.

When to Choose Waterfall:
Projects with Clearly Defined Requirements: When requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change significantly, Waterfall's sequential approach can be efficient.
Smaller Projects: For smaller projects with limited complexity, Waterfall can provide a straightforward and predictable process.
Projects with Regulatory Compliance: Waterfall's structured approach can be helpful for projects that need to adhere to strict regulations or standards.
Projects Requiring Predictable Deadlines: When a fixed deadline is crucial, Waterfall's upfront planning can help ensure timely delivery.
Example: Building a simple website with static content and a well-defined scope might be a good fit for a Waterfall methodology.
